//! The racing HUD: a speedometer, a minimap, and where everyone else is.
//!
//! The MIDlet's own HUD is a strip along the bottom of the screen.  `r.java`
//! feeds it `(int)(car.j() * 100)` and `(int)(car.j() / car.k() * 100)` - a
//! speed and its fraction of the car's maximum - and the `cg` element draws
//! that fraction as a bar (`fillRect(0, y, width * value / max, 1)`), so the
//! speedometer here is a number and a bar.
//!
//! The minimap follows `bs.a()`: it builds a `width * 3` by `height * 3` image
//! of the track, a three-pixel block per cell with the walls drawn in, and
//! `bs.a(int, int, z)` maps a position onto it.  This draws the same grid and
//! puts every car on it, with a tick along each one's heading.
